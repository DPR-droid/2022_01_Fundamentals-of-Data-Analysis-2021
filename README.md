# Fundamentals-of-Data-Analysis-2021

## Introduction
The repository is created to ensure that you have achieved the learning outcomes of the module while also providing you with sample work to show prospective employers. The overall assessment is split into the three components as detailed below.

1. GitHub Repository
2. Pyplot Notebook
3. CAO Points Notebook
4. Review the Assignment

## 1. GitHub Repository
GitHub repository containing two Jupyter notebooks

### 1.1 README.md 
This README.md file explains why the repository exists, what is in it, and how to run the notebooks

### 1.2 requirements.txt
A requirements.txt file is included to enable someone to quickly run this notebooks with minimal configuration.

## 2. Pyplot Notebook
This repository includes a Jupyter notebook called pyplot.ipynb that contains the following:

- A clear and concise overview of the matplotlib.pyplot Python package
- An in-depth explanation of three interesting plots from the matplotlib.pyplot Python package. 

# CAO Points Notebook
Include a Jupyter notebook called cao.ipynb that contains the following.

- A clear and concise overview of how to load CAO points information from the CAO website into a pandas data frame
- A detailed comparison of CAO points in 2019, 2020, and 2021 using the functionality in pandas.
- Appropriate plots and other visualisations to enhance your notebook for viewers.

4. 2018
- CAO2018_8 = 'http://www2.cao.ie/points/lvl8_18.pdf' - 914 rows × 4 columns
- CAO2018_76 = 'http://www2.cao.ie/points/lvl76_18.pdf' - 471 rows × 4 columns




# R4. Review the Assignment

How to run or review the Jupyter notebook.      

## Github
Review the assessment [Click here cao_V7.ipynb](https://github.com/DPR-droid/Fundamentals-of-Data-Analysis-2021/blob/master/cao_V7.ipynb) or [pyplot_V3.ipynb](https://github.com/DPR-droid/Fundamentals-of-Data-Analysis-2021/blob/master/pyplot_V3.ipynb)

## NBViewer
NBViewer is another way to share Jupyter Notebook.

To view the cao_V7.ipynb click this badge[![nbviewer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyter/design/master/logos/Badges/nbviewer_badge.svg)](http://nbviewer.org/github/DPR-droid/Fundamentals-of-Data-Analysis-2021/blob/master/cao_V7.ipynb)

To view the pyplot_V3.ipynb click this badge[![nbviewer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyter/design/master/logos/Badges/nbviewer_badge.svg)](http://nbviewer.org/github/DPR-droid/Fundamentals-of-Data-Analysis-2021/blob/master/pyplot_V3.ipynb)

## Binder
Try this assignment without installing by clicking the Binder badge below, this allows you to run the Jupyter notebook in an online virtual executable environment, making the code immediately reproducible by anyone, anywhere. 

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/DPR-droid/Programming-for-Data-Analysis-Project-2021/main?filepath=Programming-for-Data-Analysis-Project-2021-V1.ipynb)

**import warnings** not included in requirements.txt as it was causing an issue when building the online virtual executable environment.

## Try at home

To try this on your own PC you require the following:
- Install Anaconda https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual this ditribution includes Python and serveral packages used in this Assignment including the numpy package. 
- 'requirments.txt' for other modules required. 
- Install Jupyter https://jupyter.org/ to run cao_V7.ipynb and pyplot_V3.ipynb
- Install Github
- git clone git@github.com:DPR-droid/Fundamentals-of-Data-Analysis-2021.git
